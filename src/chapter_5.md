## Display Installed Libraries 

We installed the libraries as shown in [Chapter 3](./chapter_3.md#install-libraries)

To confirm that they have been installed and to also view all out installed libraries , 
navigate to the **Display Install Libraries** option using the arrow keys and press **Enter**. 

You will now be able to see all the libraries installed in our system.

## View Library Examples 

To make it easier for first time users , the developers of each library have created a few basic
examples that outline how to use their libraries and the functions present in those libraries. 

To see the examples of the libraries you installed , navigate to the **View Examples** option using the 
arrow keys and press **Enter**. 

Then naviggate to the library whose examples you want to view and press **Enter**. 

A viewing widget pops up that lets you see the contents of the example file. 

You won't be able to edit the file.
