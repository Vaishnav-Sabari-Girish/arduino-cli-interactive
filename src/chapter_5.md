# Chapter 5 (How to use `aci` Part 4)

**__NOTE__** : These features were introduced from `aci` version `1.0.2`. 

By the end of this chapter , you will be able to do the following : 

1. [View the basic Examples](#view-basic-examples)
2. [Display the installed libraries](#display-installed-libraries)
3. [View the library examples](#view-library-examples).

## View Basic Examples

These are the default examples that come with the Arduino IDE. These examples include code for Blinking LED, 
Basic Serial Communication, GPIO operations and more. 

To read these examples, we traverse to the `View Basic Examples` option using the arrow keys and click `Enter`. This provides us with this page. 

Here is the video

## Display Installed Libraries 

We installed the libraries as shown in [Chapter 3](./chapter_3.md#install-libraries)

To confirm that they have been installed and to also view all out installed libraries , 
navigate to the **Display Install Libraries** option using the arrow keys and press **Enter**. 

You will now be able to see all the libraries installed in our system.

## View Library Examples 

To make it easier for first time users , the developers of each library have created a few basic
examples that outline how to use their libraries and the functions present in those libraries. 

To see the examples of the libraries you installed , navigate to the **View Examples** option using the 
arrow keys and press **Enter**. 

Then navigate to the library whose examples you want to view and press **Enter**. 

A viewing widget pops up that lets you see the contents of the example file. 

You won't be able to edit the file. 

You can also search for specific phrases in the widget. 

You will also see that the *Sketch File* text on the top will have the path of the example you chose, 
making it easier for you to upload that very example if necessary.
