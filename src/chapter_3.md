# Chapter 3 (How to use `aci` Part - 2)

By the end of this chapter , you will be able to 

1. [Compile Code for a specific board](#compile-code)
2. [Upload Code to the board](#upload-code)
3. [Add 3rd party cores and install them using `arduino-cli`](#edit-configuration)

## Compile Code

To compile the code in the Sketch you created [previously](./chapter_2.md#edit-a-sketch) , we open the
and make sure that `aci` is running and you must have [Selected the Board](./chapter_2.md#select-a-board) , 
[Created a new Sketch](./chapter_2.md#create-a-new-sketch) and [Edited the Code](./chapter_2.md#edit-a-sketch). 

We then use the Arrow keys to naviigate to the **Compile Code** Option and press **Enter**. 

Since you have already selected the board , it will compile the code for that specific board. 

In the following example we will compile the code for an Arduino Nano.
